# Roadmap

Levels-style: validate manually, automate what works, compound relentlessly.

---

## Phase 1 — Validate (Months 1–2)
**Goal:** Prove patients will pay. Get first 3 customers.

- Ship 10 hand-crafted condition pages
- Full auth + Stripe billing working
- SEO foundation in place (schema, sitemap, canonicals)
- Basic homepage and about page live
- ConvertKit email capture on every page
- Submit sitemap to Google Search Console

Success gate: 3 paying customers → proceed to Phase 2.
Failure gate: 0 customers after 30 days → talk to patients, rebuild value prop.

---

## Phase 2 — Build the Engine (Months 2–4)
**Goal:** Scale to 100 condition pages. Hit $1k MRR.

- Build programmatic page pipeline (Airtable/CSV → JSON → PHP)
- Expand to 100 conditions using AI-assisted content + nurse review
- Launch /tools/prompt-generator (free SEO tool, email capture)
- Build situation hub pages (Newly Diagnosed, Understanding Lab Results, etc.)
- Internal linking automation (related_conditions array → rendered links)
- Auto-generated sitemap covers all new pages
- Annual subscription pricing added
- Basic ConvertKit email sequences (welcome, 3-day onboarding)

Success gate: 500+ monthly organic visitors, 25 paying customers.

---

## Phase 3 — Compound (Months 4–8)
**Goal:** Hit $5k MRR. Build the SEO moat.

- Scale to 500 condition pages
- Launch /blog with 10 pillar content pieces targeting head terms
- Caregiver product line (separate prompt packs framed for caregivers)
- Outreach to patient advocacy organizations (bulk licensing)
- Affiliate partnerships (telehealth, GoodRx, condition-specific apps)
- Add "Doctor Appointment Prep Kit" as premium product tier ($25–29)
- Reach out to 3–5 nursing/patient blogs for backlinks
- Google Search Console review: double down on pages with impressions but low CTR

Success gate: $5k MRR, 300+ paying customers, 5k+ monthly organic visitors.

---

## Phase 4 — Diversify (Month 8+)
**Goal:** Multiple revenue streams. Reduce single-point dependencies.

- Course: "How to Use AI to Navigate Your Health" ($49–99 one-time)
- B2B licensing to patient advocacy organizations
- White-label offering for health insurance wellness programs
- Evaluate second Levels-style project using same SEO + PHP stack
- Consider hiring a content coordinator (not a developer) if content bottleneck
